# Vialytt-Ai
Vialytt Ai is an Artificial Intelligence Agent built with #Javascript #HTML and #CSS

This agent is built entirely in the front end and is capable of basic dialogue by matching user inputs (words and phrases) with keywords and phrases stored in her brain.js and then serving one of the random responses to users as a reply.

She is also capable of basic functionality and can do such things as open new tabs or specific web pages according to matched keywords that denote functionality. She can also do things like play audio files and display images, change website backgrounds etc, and she's fully responsive. Currently she's capable of easily being plugged in to any website by adding her to your front end files. 

Note that she is not currently programmed to collect any user information. For security purposes I'll need to implement a back end database and outline the data that will be available for users via the vialytt ai interface.
